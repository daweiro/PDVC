the way grab the very top","band and bring it forward do the same on","the right side pushing back the cap in","grabbing the top band oh that's not just","happen so my cap band just actually","popped off for me so I'm going to just","quickly fix that if what happens to me","just happen to you you can just remove","the cap band grab that band pop it back","on the pin it's super easy to fit

right side and","bring that to the right so it should","look like that","turn your loom around or reach over","whichever is easier for you and now","we're going to loop the two bottom bands","on each

the","right side just like that so now they're","all in the middle","turning my loom back around again push","them down and we can go ahead and add on","our next layer again so again I'm always","going to be using my turquoise for my","outside bands so I'm laying one to the","right and one to the left and remember","now we want to bring those cap bands","over before we do anything else so","starting on the left I'm going to bring","that out and I'm doing the same on the","right side just like that pushing it","down just a little bit and now we're","going to add on our metal band so I'm","going back to my fuchsia and it doesn't","really matter if you lay the left first","or the right I would just stay","consistent so you don't you know mess up","consistency is what keeps usually","everyone on track so now that we've done","that we do need to loop the bands on","back here up and over before we do","anything else so once again you can","either reach back here and pull them","over or turn your loom around so I'm","going to grab the two bottom bands just","on the middle and bring them up turning","my loom back around we're going to now","add our copying going again","making sure they're double looped","and then my hand gets in the way when I","do my cat beans it always does so I'm","sorry but that's all I did was added my","toque a pins on and now I'm just going","to loop the middle back to themselves","and then the out ones back out so I'm","going to push my left cap in out of the","way grab that top and carefully making","sure not to lose the cap band enter the","same on the right side grab that very","top band and pull it forward now we're","going to do our turquoise or outside","bands bringing them back to themselves","as well just like that turn your loom","around now we're going to bring the","bottom two up and over again on each pin","starting from the left now in the middle","bringing those two bands up and on the","right side just like that turn your loom","back around with the air is facing to","the right push your bands down and we're","going to do that all over again so I","definitely feel like just like any","bracelet once you start doing it a few","times it definitely definitely is pretty","simple to pick up on it's just","remembering to keep bringing those bands","over so I did lay my two outside bands","so now we have to bring the cap pin up","and over just like that and now we can","go ahead and add our metal bands since","I'm alternating I'm going back to my","teal for me this was the most trickiest","part because I kept forgetting to want","to bring those bottoms up so now this is","where you want to reach back here return","your loom around I'm just going to reach","this time grab the two bottom bands on","that middle pin here and bring them up","and over just like that and it's time to","add our cap bands on again","so double-loop those cat bands just like","that and now we can go ahead and bring","them back to the middle rubbing the top","and now doing the right side and now","going back in the cap bands and bringing","the outsides out just like that","I'm going to turn my limb around and","bring the two bottom bands up and over","once again on all three of these pens","just like that turn it back around with","the air is facing to the right push your","bracelet down and we'll repeat that","again so I'm just going to keep doing it","a few times without repeating this steps","just follow along in case you haven't","picked up the steps already","okay so I feel like I've done it enough","times till you guys could definitely","pick up on the pattern and I wanted to","show you how it's growing at the bottom","so you definitely want to just come down","here give it a nice tug you can start","seeing that awesome design forming I","absolutely love how this turns out with","the little like - looking things on the","side and how it comes together in the","middle and the back looks super cool as","well so anyway I am going to go","off-camera to finish up the length of my","bracelet if you have any troubles please","watch the previous instructions and I","will come back at the end and show you","how to close it up together I'll be","right back alrighty guys so I did go","ahead and finish up the length of my","bracelet so now we can go ahead and get","it closed up together","just make sure that you did the very","less last step that you would do before","restarting that process all over again","so you're lifted look like this you","should have your two captains in the","front which would be two bands so the","two caffeine's here and then in the back","they should all be looped so there","should be two bands on each of these","three pins so it should look just like","that and if it looks like that we can go","ahead and get a close job the first","thing that we are going to do is bring","these two outside bands into the front","here so I'm just going to start on my","right side lifting these two bands off","of this top right pin and we're just","going to carefully remove them and bring","them forward like that doing the same","thing on the left side grabbing these","two and bringing them forward just like","that so now we are down to three pins","we're going to take one band I'm going","to use the same color that I was using","for my cap bands and we're just going to","wrap it around all three of these pins","right here so just one single band","stretched around all three of these","we're going to now bring the bottoms up","and over on each of the pins so I'm","going to start in the back bring that","forward we have four bands on the front","two because we have that cap band on the","bottom if you cannot grab all four you","can certainly describe to","at a time I like to grab the top two","first and then bring those over and then","grab the bottom two bring those over","doing the same on the right side as well","so now you should be left with one","single band on all three of these pins","and now we're just going to bring these","top or bottom to up to this top one it","doesn't matter which side you start on","first just be careful not to lose any of","your bands I'm going to turn my loom","around and this is where we are going to","attach our c-clip there's the total of","three bands on this pin here so just","slide your hook down in there and I","recommend doing this part on the loom","it's just a little bit easier for this","design slide you see clip one and pop it","off the loom","just like that and this bracelet I meant","to tell you does curl up but it wears","very nice when you have it on so just","give your bracelet a nice little stretch","I think it's a super cute look in here","it is before I clip it so it is","reversible and I did have a band break","I've never had that happen to her to her","before but I fixed it so it's barely","noticeable but yeah so come down here to","the other side and I just grab these two","bands right here at the very end and","clip it on like so and there you have D","complete it Norwood bracelet just zoom","out here a little bit there we go so","there you have the completed Norwood","bracelet I love this design I'm super","glad Bret was kind enough to let me do","this tutorial again as I just stated","this is the design created by Brett also","on instagram as the or the or","SCOR looming underscore center so","definitely credits to him for this","awesome design give him a follow for me","and hopefully you guys like it as much","as I do once

I'm gonna paint my","gloss black on the outside this will be","not really visible but when you look","under there and it'll look very","acceptable I'm gonna grab the camera","I'll show you what's going on yeah this","is my Connell and everything here this","is the inside of my fender you can see","here where I am where I spread my seam","sealer where I did my welding just kind","of cleans the air","this is my back fender here you can see","I just kind of blacked out the inside of","it but now that I have that done I'll","let this dry pretty good I'm gonna prep","my garage and get my get ready to put","all of these items that I'm gonna paint","on on fixtures on stands so that I get","it painted","well once I have that set I'll come back","and go through the whole paint process","with you we'll get some base coat on","these today okay so I'm back I've got my","my garage has been blown out it's all I","wet the floor down on all the edges of","the walls and nooks and crannies and","everything with a hose seal the dust","down I took my bench here I covered it","with masking paper on my fixtures that I","have my fenders on a couple of those","with masking paper","I've taken my fenders and got him","wall-mounted and everything what I did","just for a last-minute precaution was I","took a red scuff pad and I went quickly","over my fenders next thing I'm gonna do","is I'm gonna take some compressed air","mate","in the air hose and I'm gonna blow all","of my fixture my fenders all the little","nooks and crannies make sure that that","blow out all the dust or maybe even a","little bit of water or something that","might have been in there and I what's","Anthon I'm things of that nature so I'll","get that all squared away then I will do","wash it with some pretty cleaner and at","that point I'll be pretty much ready to","go I'll get my gun all set my pink ball","set and then we'll put some base to this","tape folks so I get everything blowing","off I washed everything with pre cleanup","looked it over really good I'm good to","go so I've got my garage all set what","closed up lights are on I'm going to","turn the exhaust fan on I've got my gun","set up I got my face coat I'll show you","everything and give me a little close-up","of what I got going on here okay so","here's my tank I got it set up on this","jig and I've done this in the past it","just kind of works so good I put it on","this 2x4 and then I attach it with","screws on one end I just let it sit on","the other end what I can actually do","here is I can take this tank and I can","flip it like this so I can actually get","my bottom side really good if I want to","okay and then I can flip it back like","that so it's like that so kind","seesaws back and forth so I've got that","set up over here I've got my Fender on","my jig that I have made here and I got","my other fender on this jig I got my my","spray gun and I got my base coat so I've","mixed up my base coat this is uh this is","Sherwin Williams dimension the mixin","mixing ratio is two parts of the base","one part of the reducer I'm going to put","down two to three medium coats on the on","the surface I'm going to tap

once you are done or you","think you're done with your third coat","what I would recommend is like that","flash go around look at all of your","edges bottom sides undersides everywhere","to make sure you don't have any areas","that don't have enough paint because","once you put the clear on it you're done","otherwise you start the whole process","all over again so five or ten minutes so","check for any areas that are covered","take your gun just dust in those areas","it's going to make a big difference","because it's happened to every painter","you paint something also you got a","little","or something after it's all said and","done because he didn't hit it in a","certain angle and now you know what is","sitting it doesn't have enough paint on","it and you're screwed","you

juice and it is a dietary","supplement but it's also very beneficial","to skin aloe vera is supremely healing a","lot of people use it after they get a","sunburn but if you have acne or even","rosacea or eczema it's very beneficial","it can soothe any of that redness can","suit a lot of dryness and it can really","just calm down skin so I am using","exactly one cup of aloe vera juice for","mine

is","amazing it's naturally antibacterial and","antifungal and although it is an oil is","non-comedogenic to skin it does have","some healing properties but mainly it is","this really powerful germ

find the smell","refreshing it makes me think and smell","like I'm getting clear skin which is","obviously a psychological connection","that I make to tea tree oil but it is","natural it is great and I would","definitely recommend giving it a sniff","that some people don't like it next I'm","going to","some apple cider vinegar and this one is","with the mother basically whenever","vinegar is

however much can be","super confusing because sometimes in","videos I say Oklahoma and people like no","it's Jo Jo Bob then I used to say jojoba","and people like no it's oh ho ha and","people go to the store and they're like","I saw jojoba but I didn't get it because","you said oh ho lo out or I saw a bulb up","it didn't get eggs you said jojoba","anyways that is what it is and this is","what it is so regardless of how you say","it this is how you spell it","what's amazing about this oil is it","again it is generally non comedogenic it","is supreme if you have dry skin and","don't forget most

pure rose water","you don't want it to be diluted with","other things the reason that I'm using","rose water instead of rose oil in this","particular case is because I want to","make sure that my
