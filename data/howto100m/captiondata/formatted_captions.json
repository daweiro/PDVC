your next band and this is going","to be one of the links that connects the","hearts together so whatever color like","in this case I use this solid white so","I'm just going to use this color and","then hook over the bottom layer on both","sides so that way you're left with one","layer on the pins here after that we're","going to start by making our first heart","I'm going to be using my silver for the","outside of the heart so you're going to","take your first band of whatever you're","going to use for the outside of the","heart you're going to place it on this","bottom on this left pin right here and","then you're going to twist it to the","left as you place it onto this pin","right here so if I show you that one","more time because it's very important","the direction in which you twist it put","it on this bottom pin and twist it to","the left so that way as you can see the","layer on top is this diagonal one we're","going to do another band on these two","pins here you're going to start at the","top right this time and then twist","downwards to the left so that you get","something like that so as you can see","the band that's laying on top here is","the vertical one now we are going to add","a horizontal layer of whatever color you","want the inside of your heart to be and","then we're going to do the hooking","process so you're going to go over to","this pin here and you're going to grab","this layer and pull that over the pin","and release then you're going to go over","here and grab this layer and pull that","over and release just like that and now","we're going to hook at the two bands","over here you're going to grab the very","bottom layer and pull that over and on","this side you're going to grab the very","bottom layer only and pull that over as","well and everything is going to be kind","of loose that's totally normal then","you're going to push everything down and","now we are going to do a little bit of","transferring you're going to use your","hook and grab this one band here pull it","off of the pin and then you're going to","place it onto this bottom right pin here","so don't be afraid to use your fingers","for this just in case things happen to","get loose and fall off or anything and","we're going to do the same thing to the","left side you're going to grab this band","here pull it off of the pin and then","carefully transfer it onto here make","sure that this gold band here or","whatever color you're using isn't","twisted so that way you get something","like this it's okay that these silver","bands are SuperDuper loose so don't","worry about that next you're going to","grab whatever color you're using for the","link that goes in between each of the","hearts and put that right on top so that","we get something like this and here's","where you can kind of create variations","of this bracelet after you finish making","this one but for this specific bracelet","we're going to grab the bottom two","layers on each pin","pull over so bottom two layers oops","sorry O's kind of off them Center you're","going to grab the bottom two layers and","pull over on the right and then do the","same thing on the left grab the silver","and the gold layer and pull that over so","that way all we have left is one layer","on our pin and as you can see this is","one heart right here so we're complete","we've completed that heart and we're","going to do our next one now so you're","going to go on ahead and add on your","heart bands again for the first one that","we put on the left remember we're going","to put it on the bottom one and then","twist it to the left as you place it on","that pin just like that and now we're","going to add on the one that goes on the","right side you're going to take one","single band put it on the top right pin","this time and then twist to the left as","well again twisting the bands in the","correct direction is very very important","for this you're going to next grab your","band that's going to go in the center","and now it's time to start the hooking","process for the left we're going to grab","this band right here and pull that over","the pin and release and then for the","right we're going to grab this bottom","band here and pull that over the pin and","release so that we get something like","this next for the bottom here we're","going to grab the bottom layer and pull","over grab the bottom layer again and","pull over make sure you're not going","inside of the band to grab that stay on","the outside and pull that over so after","that now we've got to make our two edges","that go together so we're going to go","here and pull this and place it onto","here make sure you're not folding over","the band's grab this top left pin and","place it over here after that it is now","time to add on our layer that links the","hearts together and then we're going to","do the hooking process so for the","hooking process you're going to grab the","bottom two and pull over and then grab","the bottom two and pull over again and","it doesn't matter you can hook the left","side first and then the right","it doesn't matter so now as you can see","we've got two hearts so far that's","basically what that looks like and then","we're going to do the same exact thing","again so I'm going to add my silver","bands on the outside this time so you're","going to start at the bottom left and","then twist that to the left then we're","going to go to the top right and twist","to the left so that way the twists are","like this so that way the diagonal ones","on top here and the vertical ones on top","over here after that we're going to add","the horizontal band on top for whatever","band's going to be in the center of the","heart and then we're going to do the","hooking process so it doesn't matter","which side you do first I just like to","do the left side first so you're going","to grab this band right here and pull","that over grab this thin right here and","pull that over just like that now we're","going to hook the bottom layers over on","these two pins here so grab the bottom","layer pull that over and grab the bottom","layer here and pull that over as well so","that way you get something like this","after that it's time to connect these","two together so you're going to grab","this side here and place that on to this","bottom pin just like that now we're","going to go on this side here grab this","band and place this band onto the bottom","right here so that way you have the","layers all together here you want to","make sure they're all together before we","add on our linking one the one that","links all the hearts together and so for","this we're going to grab the bottom two","layers and pull that up and over the pin","on both sides bottom two up and oak so","now we've got three hearts so far so","we're going to do the same exact thing","again start on the bottom left and twist","to the left so that way this layer right","here is on top","now we're going to go on the top right","and twist to the left again so that way","the vertical layers on top after that","we're going to add the center of the","heart and it's time to start the hooking","process so for the hooking process","you're grabbing whatever layers on top","as you can see this diagonal band part","is right on top so we're going to grab","that pull that over and then here the","vertical band is on top here so you're","going to pull that over and now it's","time to hook the bottom bands bottom","bands pull over bottom bands pull over","again push those down and now it's time","to make these go on the same pins so","you're going to grab this here pull that","off carefully and place that on to this","pin same thing with the left side grab","this and place this on to the left as","well so that way we've got them all on","the same pins here now it's time to grab","one single band pull that over and then","we're going to grab the bottom two","layers and pull over bottom two layers","and pull over so that we've got","something like this so far I'll be","showing you how to do the hearts three","more times so that's just to give you an","idea of how many more times I'll be","showing you how to do this again or not","again actually I haven't said this yet","but if you do have trouble with making","after I'm finished you can always rewind","and re-watch the previous instructions","and yeah so let's go ahead and start on","our first of the three so grab one of","your border bands place on the bottom","left pin and then we're going to twist","it to the left then we're going to grab","another band put it on the top right","this time and twist that to the left as","well after that we're going to grab the","band that goes into the center of the","heart and place it across the top two","pins so that way you get something like","this on your loom and it is now time to","start the hooking process so we're going","to grab the bottom layer here and pull","that over and release then we're going","to grab the layer here pull that over so","that we've got something like this","now with your hook you're going to grab","the bottom layer on the left and pull","over and the bottom layer on the right","and pull over so that way you've got","something like this on your loom now","it's time to make all these on the same","pins so you're going to grab this layer","here and transfer that right there this","layer here and transfer that down there","so that way we've got them stacked on","the pins together now we are going to go","ahead add on this layer here so that way","it goes across and then we're going to","grab the bottom two and pull over on","both sides and then we've got this heart","here so we're going to do the same thing","again pin on the bottom left and then","twist up to the top left and you're","twisting to the left on that then we're","going to start on the top right and","twist to the left so that way you get","something like this then we're going to","grab one of our horizontal bands in","place that go in across and then we are","going to do the hooking process by","grabbing this and twisting grabbing this","and twisting that over or basically what","we're doing with the hooking process is","untwisting it so that way when you got","the heart bands here none of them are","twisted so now we are going to go down","here and grab the bottom band and pull","over on both of these pins so that way","you get something like this after that","we're going to go over here and transfer","these two sides down to the bottom two","pins just like that so you've got this","here then you're going to grab one of","the chain links that links all the","hearts together and then we're going to","do the hooking process by grabbing the","bottom two and pulling over on both","sides","just like that so you should have","something like this now and the hearts","are upside down right now but anyways","I'm going to show you how to do the","heart one last time and then after that","I'll be going off-camera to finish off","my bracelet and yeah so you're going to","start on the bottom left and twist to","the left as you place it upwards then","you're going to stop on the tart tart","right what you're going to start on the","top right and twist that downwards or to","the left and pull downwards I'm getting","all tongue-tied today and then you are","going to grab whatever color you're","going to put in the center of your heart","and take your hook and we're now going","to hook these layers over at the top","here and then we're going to hook the","bottom layers over on the bottom pins","here just like that now we are going to","transfer the top to down to the bottom","two so grab that pull that down wrap","this pull this down as well and then to","finish off the heart we're going to add","a link that connects the hearts all","together bottom to pull over and bottom","to pull over so when you're finished you","should get something like this and you","may have bands that are twisted a little","bit so that way they get kind of crazy","in the links but you can always just fix","that by untwisting","so anyways this is what my love link","bracelet looks like so far I decided to","go for an elegant look with the","metallics today but anyways you're going","to go ahead and continue that same","process until you've got a full","bracelets length we're pretty close","right now I'll probably only have to do","two or three more hearts so if you're","still having trouble then feel free to","rewind the video and rewatch the","previous instructions and follow along","again if you're doing great then go","ahead and finish off your bracelet or","finish off the length of the bracelet","that you need and I will be back to show","you how to take this off of your loom","okay so I'm now finished with my","bracelet and finishing off this is","SuperDuper easy all you got to do is","grab the left side or make sure that you","finished off with one layer on","to the pins and I'm just going to grab","the left side and pull that over to the","right so that way I've got two layers on","one pin then I'm going to take my c-clip","and slide this on to both layers by the","way I am using a large c-clip today","because this is what came with my","rainbow loom silicone bands which is","really helpful in some cases when I do","have a lot of bands on my pins but","anyway just make sure your bracelet","isn't twisted and then add the cap band","layers at the beginning on to your","c-clip here and that is how you make","this really cool heart link bracelet so","anyways sorry about the name confusion","thing and yeah don't forget to give this","video a big thumbs up and also the","subscribe button down below if you","haven't already and find me on all my","social media sites that are also in the","description box below once again

is so regardless of how you say","it this is how you spell it","what's amazing about this oil is it","again it is generally non comedogenic it","is supreme if you have dry skin and","don't forget most acne prone skin is dry","skin in disguise and especially for our","backs and for our chests we normally","don't moisturize this is where the hot","hot water from the shower hits our backs","that hot water can dry out and strip our","skin so while hot showers feel good","that's why they can cause some breakouts","so this really gives that area the","hydration that it needs I'm taking 1","tbsp of it","stir stir stir very last but not least","I'm going to add rose water rose water","is amazing because it is very calming","for skin now anything in life has a","frequency a frequency is a scientific","term - how many wavelengths are given","off of a certain thing vibrant sees","basically things with a higher frequency","vibrate more or vibrate quicker things","with the lower frequency vibrate less","people who are on their deathbed and","normally have a frequency between 20 and","40 Hertz which is very very low the","human body generally functions better","higher","and that's why some people believe in","the magical healing properties of stones","because certain stones and certain rocks","have certain frequencies and when some","people wear those they feel like they","absorb that vibrational energy that is","obviously susceptible to the individual","and I'm sure different people pick up on","different things but roses rose water","rose essence and rose oil has one of the","highest frequencies I think it's around","250 to 300 which is scientifically","proven that your body can rose water is","wonderful because it naturally boosts up","your frequency which makes your cells","better at healing which makes your cells","more prone to collagen production and","which overall gives them a better","foundation to build healthy strong skin","so I am taking this and it comes in a","spray bottle already this one's just","from Whole Foods and I'm going to add","two tablespoons when it comes to your","rose water you do want to make sure that","it's a hundred percent pure rose water","you don't want it to be diluted with","other things the reason that I'm using","rose water instead of rose oil in this","particular case is because I want to","make sure that my solution is sprayable","and not all oils so now that that's in","it is time to mix this up once that is","sufficiently stirred you can put the lid","on and save it for later or you can put","it in your spray bottle and start using","it immediately this is one of my","absolute favorite concoctions or recipes","it really has saved a lot of my chest","and back acne I started doing this about","two years ago and I will never go back","there are a lot of over-the-counter","products that I look to but this is","amazing and also when we're in the","shower or when we're getting ready every","day and cleansing our face in the","morning and evening sometimes it's hard","to get our chest on our back every","single day so this is the savior and","again you spray it on it's so easy so","every single time you use it you will","have to shake it whether it's in this","container or in your spray bottle just","because oil and some of the liquids will","naturally separate but that's what it is","and I
