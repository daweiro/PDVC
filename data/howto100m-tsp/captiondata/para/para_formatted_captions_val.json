{"nxj62Bl2rrs": "hello welcome Marlin here today we're. making some undecorated pokeball cook. stay tuned for the step-by-step tutorial. here is some bread cookie dough rolled. with the thin rolling dice saran wrap. and I'm cutting some rounds here you can. just quickly go through them now once. you've done that you can easily remove. the outer dough which you can re-roll. and now you can pick this up do not. touch the cookies until they are frozen. so they don't move here is the white. dough roll to the thinnest thickness and. I'm using and I'm using my cookie cutter. here with saran wrap to bevel the edges. just like we did the red and I'm just. running through them I need eight there. we go and now I need also this small. shape this is the accent cookie for the. both of all and now I can remove my. excess dough and pop these in the. freezer alright I'm ready to cut the. base cookie I'm using the cutter just. the next size up and I'm cutting nine. out so that I can assemble the cookies. together now if you had all these. chances are you'll make the round not. exactly round for you better that pick. them up put them in the freezer before. you touch them I have all my pieces here. and I'm going to show you how to quickly. assemble this stack your two white and. red cookies together now we're going to. take a big cutter and we're cutting. right through the two of them and. cutting again to get like that band. around the edge of the cocoa ball now. I'm taking the circle to cut. this oh now this is pretty much all. disposed of we don't use that now we put. these halves on the chocolate base and. then we put the little chocolate circle. there and now I'm adding the white just. above like so and like so there we go. we can just give that a press to adhere. it to the surface of the cookie and. there we have our cookies coming along. you can already see the design as you. work on the cookies they obviously melt. and so don't handle them when they're. getting soft because they will warp so. right now they're on the cookie sheet so. they're pretty safe and I'm just adding. those little rounds that I did in white. to the center here of our chocolate. cookie just give it a little press like. so. my focal ball cookies are almost done. and I'm just adding now a little bit of. chocolate cookie dough right in that. little gap and I'm rolling hand rolling. some chocolate dough and I'm just. placing that in in that opening and. that's it you see. there that was pretty easy I am quite. pleased I think they look pretty. authentic and really you don't require. any skill to do this if you can roll out. cookie dough you can do this so thanks. so much for watching I hope you enjoyed. the video please subscribe and I'll see. you next time. you", "7nBXRFZ67FA": "Hey guys, it\u2019s Ro, welcome to another Nerdy\nNummies!. It is summer time and it is really heating\nup here in California so. I thought, let\u2019s make a chilled Geeky Treat\ntoday, so today we are gonna. be making some homemade Game Boy Ice Cream\nSandwiches, let\u2019s get started!. If you would like to make these super easy\nmode, you can just buy the pre-made. Ice Cream rectangle sandwiches that you find\nat the grocery store.. But I\u2019m gonna be making mine from scratch,\nso that I can make them a little bit. bigger, to look like the actual\nGame Boy size.. But, if you\u2019re in a hurry and you want to\nmake some cold treats for summertime,. you can just buy the pre-made ice cream sandwiches.. So the things you will need to make these\nfrom scratch, will be:. 2-2/3 Cups of flour, 1 cup of sugar, 2 eggs, 2-1/2\nsticks of unsalted butter,. 3/4 cup of cocoa powder, 1/2 a teaspoon of\nsalt, and 1 tablespoon. of vanilla extract. You\u2019ll also need a cookie\nsheet and a piece of fitted. parchment paper, and I\u2019ve got a little lollipop\nstick.. For the middle of the sandwich you\u2019ll need\nsome ice cream, here I\u2019ve got. classic vanilla ice cream, but you can use\nwhatever ice cream flavor is. your favorite. Then to decorate we\u2019re gonna\nneed green and black candy melts,. and some M&amp;M\u2019s. You will also need a big\nmixing bowl and a small mixing bowl,. sifter, whisk, a flipper-flapper\u2026. This\nis called a spatula.. And an electric mixer, now let\u2019s put it\nall together!. The first thing that we\u2019re gonna be doing\nis scooping our ice cream into. a cookie sheet, but we\u2019re first gonna line\nour cookie sheet with a piece of. wax paper, ooop!. If you don\u2019t have a cookie sheet, you can\njust use a glass pan, anything. that you\u2019d like. I like the cookie sheet\nbecause it is about an inch tall.. And that is how tall exactly I want my little\nIce Cream Sandwich filling to be.. And now we\u2019re gonna scoop, scoop, scoop!. Come on now!. Come on now!. Come on!. Oh my gosh he\u2019s frozen on there!. Now that we\u2019ve got all of our ice cream\nin the pan, you\u2019re gonna take a spoon,. and smooth it over. Bewm!. Now you\u2019re gonna pop this in the freezer\nto re-freeze, for about an hour or two.. And while it\u2019s re-freezing, we are gonna\nmake our cookies!. The first thing that we\u2019re gonna do to make\nthese cookies is: In a small bowl. we are gonna sift our flour and cocoa powder.\nNow we\u2019re gonna whisk them together. and set this off to the side.. Next, in a medium bowl, we are gonna cream\ntogether our butter, sugar and salt.. I like to add my butter first, and then mix\nit together until it\u2019s smooth,. and then you\u2019re gonna mix in your sugar and\nsalt until it\u2019s evenly combined.. Now that we got those all mixed up we are\ngonna add 2 egg yolks, remember. just the yellow part into our mixture.. And then you\u2019re gonna add your vanilla extract,\nooooh!. And then mix it up one more time until everything\nis evenly combined.. Now we have our butter mixture and our dry\nmixture, and we are going to combine. them, I\u2019m going to add the dry mixture to\nthe butter mixture in thirds, and mix. them up in-between until they are evenly combined.. Got our cookie dough all mixed up and I just\nput it on top of my counter.. And I lightly covered the surface with flour\nso that the cooke dough doesn\u2019t stick.. And if it\u2019s a little bit crumbly, that\u2019s\nOK! This is a drier recipe, I love. this drier cookie recipe because it compliments\nthe ice cream so well!. It\u2019s really good!. So don\u2019t worry about the little crumbles\u2026\nYou just squish it together!. Now I\u2019m just gonna pack it down with my hands\nto be somewhat flat, and then. grab a rolling pin, and smooth it out!. Just rolled out our dough and now we\u2019re\ngonna cut out our little rectangle cookies.. Cut as many as you\u2019d like. Just remember\nyou\u2019ll need 2 cookies to complete. your ice cream sandwich.. Remove the excess dough around your cookies\nand then scoop them onto your. baking sheet.. Got all of our cookies on the sheet and now\nfor that classic Ice Cream Sandwich. look, we\u2019re gonna poke little holes on the\ntop.. I like to start with three holes, and then\ntwo, and then three, and then two. and then three and then two and then three!. While the cookies are baking (at 350 Degrees\nfor 14 Minutes),. we are gonna make some decorations.. We are going to make the screen on the little\nGame Boy and some buttons.. Bewp!. While the cookies are baking, we are gonna\nmake some decorations.. I printed out these two templates, and I\u2019ll\nput a link down below if you\u2019d. like to use these, or you can make your own,\nwhatever you\u2019d like.. Take a little tape, tape \u2018em down to the\nsurface, then you\u2019re gonna. take this piece of wax paper and place it\non top, now we are going to trace. and fill in our little designs with our melted\ncandy.. In this plastic bag I melted the black candy\nmelts, and I put a number. two tip at the top for a little bit more control,\nand then I\u2019m gonna use it to. trace and fill in these little Dpads.. Now we got our Dpads done, and now we are gonna\nuse the green candy melts to make our screens.. Once your cookies have finished baking and\nthey\u2019ve had plenty of time to cool,. now we are going to decorate, my favorite\npart!. So over here I just took a few of the cookies,\nthese are gonna be the tops. of the Ice Cream Sandwiches. And we are going\nto attach our little screens. and Dpads, and then our mini M&amp;M\u2019s, we\u2019re\ngonna be using two little red M&amp;M\u2019s. for the buttons.. To attach the little details I\u2019m gonna be\nusing some of the extra dark. candy melts in this little plastic baggie,\nas adhesive.. So you\u2019re just gonna take one of these little\nguys, bewp!. And on the back put a little dab of your candy\nmelt, and then place it on top. of your ice cream sandwich.. Then we\u2019re gonna attach a little Dpad and\nwe got our mini M&amp;Ms, for the little buttons.. Then you\u2019re gonna do this to the rest of\nyour cookies!. Our cookies are assembled and now I just took\nout the tray of frozen Ice Cream,. And now you\u2019re gonna take your rectangle\ncookie cutter, and we're gonna. cut out the middle of our ice cream sandwiches,\nand this doesn\u2019t have a really. soft, grippy top, so I\u2019m gonna be using\nmy mitt, so it doesn\u2019t hurt your hands,. and then you gotta put some pressure on the\ntop.. Eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee-eee!. This is called the jumping technique. Then you pull it out, perfect, just like that!. Then you\u2019re gonna place it onto a little\ncutting board over here.. You\u2019re gonna cut out as many as you can\nin the Ice Cream tray, and then pop. these back in the freezer so that they\u2019ll\nhold their shape and we will. assemble our cookies!. Ta-da!. Here are the Game Boy Home-Made Ice Cream\nSandwiches that we made today!. I hope you guys enjoyed them, I love them,\nthey\u2019re just like little,. retro-geeky, summer treats to keep you cool!. I\u2019ll be posting lots of pictures on Facebook,\nTumblr, Instagram and Twitter!.

Me Too.. Let's begin. So the First thing you'll want to do is clean\nthe dog piss out of your rims.. Literally, and metaphorically.. Dry the rim thoroughly with a clean rag.. Tape off your bearings with transparent tape,\nand block the threads that mount your brake disks.. I was able to stuff it with random paper &amp; plastic\nthat was laying around the garage cause after. all, I am a professional.. After you've prepped both sides, it's time\nto get to spraying.. Make sure you're in a well lit, ventilated\narea, where the rim has no contact with the. sun.. The last thing you want is some asshole star\nfrom 93 million miles away to fuck up your. paint job.. After shaking the can vigorously for a full\nminute like it just told you your bike was. slow, you're going to want to give it a test\nspray on a piece of cardboard, paper, your. cat, or your test piece of choice.. For the first coat you want to start off with\na light coat of about a 50%-60% coverage.. Much like spray painting, this thin layer\nwill help create a much better bond than if. you were to disperse a full coat.. Be sure to spray in short bursts, and always\nmove the can while spraying.. After you let the first coat dry for about\n30 min.. Spray the second coat at about 95%-100% coverage.. The main goal here is to apply the coat evenly\nacross the entire wheel.. Allow another 30 min to dry.. Based on your particular Plasti Dip project\nthe can may have enough for a fourth coat.. Although I could've sprayed a fourth layer,\nI decided to empty the can for the third coat. for a thicker layer.. Finally, to achieve an attractive shine to\nmatch my bald head, and provide protection. form the elements, I added 1 coat of Plasti\nDip Enhancer Glossifier.. After about an hour, remove the excess Plasti\nDip from your tire.. Contrary to what I've done here, I suggest\nusing painters tape for the chicken strips. during preparation.. If you choose not to, you can use something\nlike brake cleaner to remove the Plasti Dip. that's too thin to peel off.. Finally, take the time to pat yourself on\nthe back, admire your work, &amp; Let it cure. for about 8 hours before you install the tire.. Alright guys so I think it came out looking\npretty fan fuckin tastic.. I hope you guys got some kind of value out\nof the video.. If you did spread some love, like, ask some\nquestions, I'll respond.. And, if you wanna see pictures I'm gonna post\nsome pictures on my instagram probably by. tomorrow when I actually get it on the bike.. But, yeah.. Thank you guys for watching, and we'll catch\nyou guys later.. Peace. Alright guys that's.... Alright guys, I hope you guys hahaha\nIf you guys did enjoy the video be sure to. like comment subscribe god damnit.. Hahahaha, oh shit.", "HnTLh99gcxY": "previously on customer mods they've had. too faded damage paint from motorcycle. so you've tasted the whole thing put. some primer on it now is in the spray. booth. pretty good and custom paint job all. right so I decided to paint my whole. bike the track race bearings and. everything not just the tank in the and. the plastic parts so I'm going to paint. it in a flurry color which was suggested. by someone on my last video and I picked. the color scheme from the n GM Ford. Racing team colors I'm a big fan of. MotoGP so I thought I'll give this color. scheme ago and yeah I'm uh prepared now. clean the oil with wax and grease. remover I'm about to spray some 2k. transparent sealer on it which is going. to help the new paint stick and then. I'll be ready to start my color scheme. so let's do it. the 2k Cielo is like a niche promoter. but a lot better quality to that I like. to put that down especially when I'm. asking outlines that helps the paint. stick a lot that up. we've got a lot of black in this colors. game bring this bright black down to us. to pull the pots then I'll be ready to. start mopping up. my best time data people. well they're all the file tents. okay so just master that all about lines. now I'm going to do my first color but. first we're going to spray white down. one down first because the fluo colours. really need to go over a white base to. get the fire reflective book so instead. of just playing it over black I'm going. to kind of white and I'm then British my. bluest. now I'm using the spray cheap. fluorescent colors spray cheap is an. Australian company it's made in. Australia and they provide quality. custom paints including candies curls. and many other custom tanks and yes good. start. okay so now I'm masking up my lines for. the next color I've done the orange or. red actually thread for yours. something watches. something a letter color scheme. now hopefully it all works out an excuse. okay so most of what I won Lansford what. and already carried one through. dude zero colors by spreadsheet our bass. player it's a clearer debate color so. I'm going to spray the bass down first. then let that dry for about ten to. fifteen minutes then I'll spray a clear. coat on top. okay now I'm going to spray a two-pack. satin tweeter it's going to be about 50. cent gloss so it's not going to be full. gloss but it's still going to do the. 2-pack detection and that's because the. fuel resistance and chemical resistance. great for motorcycles. well there you go I paint my bike in a. fluro color scheme I had a real damage. paint work to start with so I paint. stripped it all off got it down to bare. metal at bare plastic then I painted the. whole thing in the color scheme I wanted. using a fluro color made sure I got a. white base down first put the fluro on. top of that and then try to sweep it on. top so that's how you paint your colors. make sure you get that white down first. put the fluo on then you put a clear. coat on to protect it so I'm yeah pretty. ho with the with the finish and next. time. you", "dgkt4W8fWVA": "hi everyone its tutorials by I here and. I am filming the intro and outro here. for the second time because it turns out. I chose a name that was it's like one. letter away from being the same thing as. another rainbow loom bracelets name it. was originally the love link bracelet. but there's a bracelet called the love. links bracelet so I am changing this. name to the heart link bracelet so. anyway it's in the tutorial if you ever. hear me call this the love link bracelet. just completely ignore me because I'm. just refilling the intro and outro only. so anyways don't forget to give this. video a big thumbs up and now without. further ado let's get started so today. you will need any type of loom you can. also use a monster tail for this design. but I won't be doing a tutorial on that. since it's pretty easy to transfer the. design you'll also need about 35 to 40. bands today I'll be using the rainbow. loom comm silicone bands and the colors. of metallic gold metallic silver and. glitter white you will also need a hook. I'll be using a metal tip took today. however this bracelet does not cause any. stress on your hook at all pretty much. so you can use any kind of hook and. you'll also need one c-clip all eye. supplies today are from rainbow loom. calm and now without further ado let's. get started first off you're going to. take whatever color you're using for. your cap band and twist that on two pins. so that way you've got a figure eight. here and it doesn't matter the direction. that it's twisted in then you're going. to take your next band and this is going. to be one of the links that connects the. hearts together so whatever color like. in this case I use this solid white so. I'm just going to use this color and. then hook over the bottom layer on both. sides so that way you're left with one. layer on the pins here after that we're. going to start by making our first heart. I'm going to be using my silver for the. outside of the heart so you're going to. take your first band of whatever you're. going to use for the outside of the. heart you're going to place it on this. bottom on this left pin right here and. then you're going to twist it to the. left as you place it onto this pin. right here so if I show you that one. more time because it's very important. the direction in which you twist it put. it on this bottom pin and twist it to. the left so that way as you can see the. layer on top is this diagonal one we're. going to do another band on these two. pins here you're going to start at the. top right this time and then twist. downwards to the left so that you get. something like that so as you can see. the band that's laying on top here is. the vertical one now we are going to add. a horizontal layer of whatever color you. want the inside of your heart to be and. then we're going to do the hooking. process so you're going to go over to. this pin here and you're going to grab. this layer and pull that over the pin. and release then you're going to go over. here and grab this layer and pull that. over and release just like that and now. we're going to hook at the two bands. over here you're going to grab the very. bottom layer and pull that over and on. this side you're going to grab the very. bottom layer only and pull that over as. well and everything is going to be kind. of loose that's totally normal then. you're going to push everything down and. now we are going to do a little bit of. transferring you're going to use your. hook and grab this one band here pull it. off of the pin and then you're going to. place it onto this bottom right pin here. so don't be afraid to use your fingers. for this just in case things happen to. get loose and fall off or anything and. we're going to do the same thing to the. left side you're going to grab this band. here pull it off of the pin and then. carefully transfer it onto here make. sure that this gold band here or. whatever color you're using isn't. twisted so that way you get something. like this it's okay that these silver. bands are SuperDuper loose so don't. worry about that next you're going to. grab whatever color you're using for the. link that goes in between each of the. hearts and put that right on top so that. we get something like this and here's. where you can kind of create variations. of this bracelet after you finish making. this one but for this specific bracelet. we're going to grab the bottom two. layers on each pin. pull over so bottom two layers oops. sorry O's kind of off them Center you're. going to grab the bottom two layers and. pull over on the right and then do the. same thing on the left grab the silver. and the gold layer and pull that over so. that way all we have left is one layer. on our pin and as you can see this is. one heart right here so we're complete. we've completed that heart and we're. going to do our next one now so you're. going to go on ahead and add on your. heart bands again for the first one that. we put on the left remember we're going. to put it on the bottom one and then. twist it to the left as you place it on. that pin just like that and now we're. going to add on the one that goes on the. right side you're going to take one. single band put it on the top right pin. this time and then twist to the left as. well again twisting the bands in the. correct direction is very very important. for this you're going to next grab your. band that's going to go in the center. and now it's time to start the hooking. process for the left we're going to grab. this band right here and pull that over. the pin and release and then for the. right we're going to grab this bottom. band here and pull that over the pin and. release so that we get something like. this next for the bottom here we're. going to grab the bottom layer and pull. over grab the bottom layer again and. pull over make sure you're not going. inside of the band to grab that stay on. the outside and pull that over so after. that now we've got to make our two edges. that go together so we're going to go. here and pull this and place it onto. here make sure you're not folding over. the band's grab this top left pin and. place it over here after that it is now. time to add on our layer that links the. hearts together and then we're going to. do the hooking process so for the. hooking process you're going to grab the. bottom two and pull over and then grab. the bottom two and pull over again and. it doesn't matter you can hook the left. side first and then the right. it doesn't matter so now as you can see. we've got two hearts so far that's. basically what that looks like and then. we're going to do the same exact thing. again so I'm going to add my silver. bands on the outside this time so you're. going to start at the bottom left and. then twist that to the left then we're. going to go to the top right and twist. to the left so that way the twists are. like this so that way the diagonal ones. on top here and the vertical ones on top. over here after that we're going to add. the horizontal band on top for whatever. band's going to be in the center of the. heart and then we're going to do the. hooking process so it doesn't matter. which side you do first I just like to. do the left side first so you're going. to grab this band right here and pull. that over grab this thin right here and. pull that over just like that now we're. going to hook the bottom layers over on. these two pins here so grab the bottom. layer pull that over and grab the bottom. layer here and pull that over as well so. that way you get something like this. after that it's time to connect these. two together so you're going to grab. this side here and place that on to this. bottom pin just like that now we're. going to go on this side here grab this. band and place this band onto the bottom. right here so that way you have the. layers all together here you want to. make sure they're all together before we. add on our linking one the one that. links all the hearts together and so for. this we're going to grab the bottom two. layers and pull that up and over the pin. on both sides bottom two up and oak so. now we've got three hearts so far so. we're going to do the same exact thing. again start on the bottom left and twist. to the left so that way this layer right. here is on top. now we're going to go on the top right. and twist to the left again so that way. the vertical layers on top after that. we're going to add the center of the. heart and it's time to start the hooking. process so for the hooking process. you're grabbing whatever layers on top. as you can see this diagonal band part. is right on top so we're going to grab. that pull that over and then here the. vertical band is on top here so you're. going to pull that over and now it's. time to hook the bottom bands bottom. bands pull over bottom bands pull over. again push those down and now it's time. to make these go on the same pins so. you're going to grab this here pull that. off carefully and place that on to this. pin same thing with the left side grab. this and place this on to the left as. well so that way we've got them all on. the same pins here now it's time to grab. one single band pull that over and then. we're going to grab the bottom two. layers and pull over bottom two layers. and pull over so that we've got. something like this so far I'll be. showing you how to do the hearts three. more times so that's just to give you an. idea of how many more times I'll be. showing you how to do this again or not. again actually I haven't said this yet. but if you do have trouble with making. after I'm finished you can always rewind. and re-watch the previous instructions. and yeah so let's go ahead and start on. our first of the three so grab one of. your border bands place on the bottom. left pin and then we're going to twist. it to the left then we're going to grab. another band put it on the top right. this time and twist that to the left as. well after that we're going to grab the. band that goes into the center of the. heart and place it across the top two. pins so that way you get something like. this on your loom and it is now time to. start the hooking process so we're going. to grab the bottom layer here and pull. that over and release then we're going. to grab the layer here pull that over so. that we've got something like this. now with your hook you're going to grab. the bottom layer on the left and pull. over and the bottom layer on the right. and pull over so that way you've got. something like this on your loom now. it's time to make all these on the same. pins so you're going to grab this layer. here and transfer that right there this. layer here and transfer that down there. so that way we've got them stacked on. the pins together now we are going to go. ahead add on this layer here so that way. it goes across and then we're going to. grab the bottom two and pull over on. both sides and then we've got this heart. here so we're going to do the same thing. again pin on the bottom left and then. twist up to the top left and you're. twisting to the left on that then we're. going to start on the top right and. twist to the left so that way you get. something like this then we're going to. grab one of our horizontal bands in. place that go in across and then we are. going to do the hooking process by. grabbing this and twisting grabbing this. and twisting that over or basically what. we're doing with the hooking process is. untwisting it so that way when you got. the heart bands here none of them are. twisted so now we are going to go down. here and grab the bottom band and pull. over on both of these pins so that way. you get something like this after that. we're going to go over here and transfer. these two sides down to the bottom two. pins just like that so you've got this. here then you're going to grab one of. the chain links that links all the. hearts together and then we're going to. do the hooking process by grabbing the. bottom two and pulling over on both. sides. just like that so you should have. something like this now and the hearts. are upside down right now but anyways. I'm going to show you how to do the. heart one last time and then after that. I'll be going off-camera to finish off. my bracelet and yeah so you're going to. start on the bottom left and twist to. the left as you place it upwards then. you're going to stop on the tart tart. right what you're going to start on the. top right and twist that downwards or to. the left and pull downwards I'm getting. all tongue-tied today and then you are. going to grab whatever color you're. going to put in the center of your heart. and take your hook and we're now going. to hook these layers over at the top. here and then we're going to hook the. bottom layers over on the bottom pins. here just like that now we are going to. transfer the top to down to the bottom. two so grab that pull that down wrap. this pull this down as well and then to. finish off the heart we're going to add. a link that connects the hearts all. together bottom to pull over and bottom. to pull over so when you're finished you. should get something like this and you. may have bands that are twisted a little. bit so that way they get kind of crazy. in the links but you can always just fix. that by untwisting. so anyways this is what my love link. bracelet looks like so far I decided to. go for an elegant look with the. metallics today but anyways you're going. to go ahead and continue that same. process until you've got a full. bracelets length we're pretty close. right now I'll probably only have to do. two or three more hearts so if you're. still having trouble then feel free to. rewind the video and rewatch the. previous instructions and follow along. again if you're doing great then go. ahead and finish off your bracelet or. finish off the length of the bracelet. that you need and I will be back to show. you how to take this off of your loom. okay so I'm now finished with my. bracelet and finishing off this is. SuperDuper easy all you got to do is. grab the left side or make sure that you. finished off with one layer on. to the pins and I'm just going to grab. the left side and pull that over to the. right so that way I've got two layers on. one pin then I'm going to take my c-clip. and slide this on to both layers by the. way I am using a large c-clip today. because this is what came with my. rainbow loom silicone bands which is. really helpful in some cases when I do. have a lot of bands on my pins but. anyway just make sure your bracelet. isn't twisted and then add the cap band. layers at the beginning on to your. c-clip here and that is how you make. this really cool heart link bracelet so. anyways sorry about the name confusion. thing and yeah don't forget to give this. video a big thumbs up and also the. subscribe button down below if you. haven't already and find me on all my. social media sites that are also in the. description box below once again thank. you all so much for watching this video. and I will see you all in my next. tutorial bye", "suT1GtuvXzU": "Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now I'm\ngoing to show you how to roll the dough. First. I divide the dough into 3 parts. So it would\nnot be too hard to work with. I'm putting. the first piece on the table and just squishing\nit a little bit so it would be easier to roll. it. I'm just taking the rolling pin and rolling\nit. It should not be too thin. It should be. about half a inch thick. Once I finish the\nfirst one, I'm going to do the second one. to and the third one after that because it\nis just more convenient to first roll all. the dough. Then to shape it. Remember not\nto make it too thin cause you would not be. able to put the wooden sticks in. The second\none is done and I'm going to take the the. third one and do the same thing over again."}
